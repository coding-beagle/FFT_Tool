# FFTTool

FFTTool is designed to be a simple tool for playing around with signals in the browser.

The goal is to implement:

- A text based input for graphing functions in real time
- Show the FFT of those functions in real time
- Ways of modifying the signal spectrum in the frequency domain and propagating that to the time domain, e.g. adding filters, etc
